\section{Initial objectives}
Learn the basics of :\\
- Lora point-to-point communication with the MKR1310 and the Pycom's LoPy\\
- Lora modulation 

\section{Material and software used}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2 Arduino MKR1310
  \item Usb docking station
  \item Arduino IDE
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
I set up my laptop with the arduino IDE and downloaded the nessecary library to use the Lora module of the MKR1310.\\
I could emit Lora signals but not receive them.

\section{Problems encountered} 
I got some issues configuring the arduino IDE.\\
The MKR1310 boards had some powering issues which lead to communication issues with my laptop.\\
We figured out with Aqeel that one of the MKR1310 I was using was not working properly.

\section{Solutions found}
All my IDE issues were solved by following \href{https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arduino}{this arch linux guide}\\
as for the defective board, I'll simply check if I can emit signals with each board.

\section{Conclusion}
I now have a configured laptop for point-to-point communication with working boards.

\section{Next time}
I'ld like to sucessfully communicate for one board to another.\\
And try to take a look at LoRa signals with URH.
